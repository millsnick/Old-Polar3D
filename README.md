# Old-Polar3D
This repository contains all the files needed to get up and running with an old Polar 3D printer. 

By "old" I mean the version that is not dependent on cloud printing. This is several years the ancestor of the current printers. Who knows, maybe I am the only one who even has one anymore! 

If your printer doesn't look something like the one below, you may want to seek assistance elsewhere.
